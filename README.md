# RouRouThreadPool

## __Name Origin__  

Actually RouRou is my daughter's nickname and she is my adorable angel.  

Bofore RouRou was born, I led a mess life, had a bad relationship with my wife, then RouRou was born, I suddenly found that what so fuck am I, I recognized myself as a good, kind-hearted person, had a good character, had enough patience, yes, what you see is __<font color=red> "had" </font>__. It's not true, I am not a good person, had little patience, but I  always touched by myself, what a shame!  

When I was a freshman, my classmate told me some words that his father told him "When you were born, My life doesn't belong to me." I have to take the responsibility for my daughter, I must do my best to give her a good life, no worry about starve, I will never push her to get a high score, all I what is that she owns a healthy body, lead a happy and free life. 

I put this naming-convention as a signal, a promise for my daughter —— I love you so much, and I don't want anything in return.
